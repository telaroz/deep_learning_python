Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System for Smart Parking Access
=========================================================================

Objective:
----------
The project aims to develop an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system using a YOLOv8 object detection model to detect vehicle license plates. This system can be applied in smart parking systems for automatic vehicle identification and access control.

Project Pipeline:
-----------------
1. **Data Collection**:
   - A labeled dataset of European-style vehicle images with annotated license plates was used.
   - Each image contains bounding boxes around license plates, formatted for YOLO object detection.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Images were annotated using bounding boxes and converted into the YOLOv8 format.
   - Training and validation datasets were split and structured in folders.

3. **Model Training**:
   - The YOLOv8 architecture from Ultralytics was used for training.
   - Training was done using a custom configuration file and pre-trained weights.
   - Epochs, batch size, and image resolution were tuned to optimize accuracy.
   - Loss curves were monitored to evaluate training and validation performance.

4. **Results**:
   - Training images (`train_batch0.jpg`, `train_batch1.jpg`, `train_batch2.jpg`) show successful detection of license plates.
   - The model achieved stable convergence and accurate bounding box predictions for most test images.

5. **Model Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Detection was performed on new images (e.g., `image1.jpg`) for real-world validation.
   - Detected license plates were to be passed through an OCR module (Tesseract) to extract alphanumeric characters.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Integrate the YOLO model with Tesseract OCR to extract text from predicted bounding boxes.
   - Improve accuracy by enhancing image preprocessing (e.g., binarization, thresholding).
   - Deploy the model on edge devices or cloud for real-time ALPR in smart parking systems.

Conclusion:
-----------
The YOLOv8 model was successfully trained to detect vehicle license plates with high accuracy. The next phase involves integrating OCR and deploying the system in practical smart parking scenarios.
