# Project Setup

This repository uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle large files, such as models in the `/models` directory.

You must have Git LFS installed on your system to clone this repository correctly and retrieve the large model files.

## Install Git LFS (if needed) 
- Download and install Git LFS from [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
- After installation, initialize LFS for your user account (only needs to be done once per machine):

```bash
git lfs install
```

## Cloning the Repository

Once Git LFS is installed, you can clone the repository as usual
