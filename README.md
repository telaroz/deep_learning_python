# Deep Learning with python project


## Project 1 Summary

The aim of this project is to familiarize students with the different sub-tasks that exist in the
realm of Computer Vision. The objective of this project is to select one sub-task in Computer
Vision and solve it with a model of the students’ choice.
Students have complete control over the datasets and the model selection. However, the
methodology should be justified and reproducible. This is a chance to get students to work
in the field of their liking and practically handle complex models.
The sub-tasks can be found here: https://huggingface.co/tasks.

## Project Evaluation:
All projects will be evaluated using the following rubric. It contains the required items for a
complete submission. The grading system is over 5 and the final grade will be transformed to
a grade over 100.
● Dataset distillation [1 point]
● Model architecture and code [1 point]
● Project report [1 point]
● Project reproducibility (requirements file with necessary packages, README file for
running the project, environment, model code) [1 point]
● Project hosting and deployment (Github, Docker, AWS, Hugging Face Hub or any
other method) [1 point]
